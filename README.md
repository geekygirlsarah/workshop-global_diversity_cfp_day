# Global Diversity CFP Day
Pittsburgh's Global Diversity CFP Day (https://www.globaldiversitycfpday.com/events/92)

## About
Global Diversity CFP* Day is an international event designed to help underrepresented folks in tech get on stage at events. This year we're bringing the event to Pittsburgh!

Ever wanted to speak in public but not sure how to get started? Ever wished that tech events were more diverse and think you should be a part of it? Then this event is for you!

Speaking at conferences, meetups, and other events can boost your career, inspire innovation in your company, and even spur your entire field forward. It’s also a great way to deepen your expertise, gain confidence, and help new engineers or designers grow. But it’s scary to hit send on that first proposal—especially when you’re not used to seeing people like you on stage.

We'll provide:
- an overview of the logistics and mechanics of choosing your topic
- crafting a proposal
- describing yourself and writing a bio
- giving a dynamic talk
- some current conference CFPs that are open

There will be break out sessions to work on your own materials and gather feedback from peers and mentors. We'll end the day with a group discussion of key topics and some casual networking.

We'll have experienced mentors on hand to answer questions, provide personalized feedback, and help all feel welcome.

We value the diversity and inclusion of underrepresented and marginalized people in tech. Before signing up, please take a moment to read the event's Code of Conduct as well as Code & Supply's Code of Conduct.
